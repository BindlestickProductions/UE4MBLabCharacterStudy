Since I cant upload files larger than 25 mb.
The character is the first layer and is very tiny compared to ready to export character on layer 4
ponytail is on layer 1 note that it is a separate skeleton but it is also possible to add it to the existing mblab skeleton if you need to.
2nd layer has lights and camera
3rd layer has armature for the character on layer one
